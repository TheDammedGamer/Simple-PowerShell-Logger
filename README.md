# Simple PowerShell Logger Module
This is a simple Module I have to be created to handle with logging inside of my scripts and modules.

## Examples

1. Create a New Log Called 'DeploymentLog' in the default location.
``` PowerShell
 $Logger = New-Logger -Name 'DeploymentLog'
 $Logger.Log("Create a New Log Entry")
```

This will create the log file at ` C:\PSLogging\Log.$LogName.dd.mm.yyyy.log` and add a new entry with the specified text.

2. Create a New Log at the Specified Path
``` PowerShell
#Prepare the Path Variable
$LogPath = 'D:\Logs\Deployment.' + $(get-date -Format "yyyy.MM.dd").ToString() + '.log'
#Create the Logger Class
$Logger = New-Logger -Name 'DeploymentLog' -FilePath $LogPath
#Write to the Log file and console.
$Logger.Log('Deployment Script Started')
```

## PowerShell Help Files
The help documents for this module are created using PlatyPS which converts markdown to PowerShell help files.

The Documentation can be found in the `.\docs` folder.

If updating the help files please run the following commands to update the PowerShell help files aswell.

``` PowerShell
#If necessary istall the PlatyPs module
